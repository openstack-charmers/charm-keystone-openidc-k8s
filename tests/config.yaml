      See the README for more details.
  tls-ca-openidc:
    type: string
    default: null
    description: |
      This option controls which certificate (or a chain) will be used to connect
      to an openidc server(s) over TLS. Certificate contents should be either used
      directly or included via include-file://
      An OpenIDC url should also be considered as openidcs and StartTLS are both valid
      methods of using TLS (see RFC 4513) with StartTLS using a non-openidcs url which,
      of course, still requires a CA certificate.
